- in this page we are rendering all the orders the currently 
logged in user is involved in, w the ids of people who are on the other side of the order, the particular gig for which the order is made and the price of the gig and a contact btn

- so there is an img (button) which when clicked will lead to 
a conversation with the seller/buyer involved in that order
- on button click if this particular convo exists already, if 
it does navigate the user to that direct message page, else
create a conversation and then navigate the user
